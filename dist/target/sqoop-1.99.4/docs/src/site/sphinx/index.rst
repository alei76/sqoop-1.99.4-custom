Apache Sqoop documentation
=======================================

Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring data betweeen structured, semi-structured and unstructured data sources. Relational databases are examples of structured data sources with well defined schema for the data they store. Cassandra, Hbase are  examples of semi-structured data sources and HDFS is an example of unstructured data source that Sqoop can support.
