<h1>Upgrade<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page describes procedure that you need to take in order to upgrade Sqoop from one release to a higher release. Upgrading both client and server component will be discussed separately.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Only updates from one Sqoop 2 release to another are covered, starting with upgrades from version 1.99.2. This guide do not contain general information how to upgrade from Sqoop 1 to Sqoop 2.</p>

<div class="section" id="upgrading-server">
<h2>Upgrading Server<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As Sqoop server is using a database repository for persisting sqoop entities such as the connector, driver, links and jobs the repository schema might need to be updated as part of the server upgrade. In addition the configs and inputs described by the various connectors and the driver may also change with a new server version and might need a data upgrade.</p>
<p>There are two ways how to upgrade Sqoop entities in the repository, you can either execute upgrade tool or configure the sqoop server to perform all necessary upgrades on start up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s strongly advised to back up the repository before moving on to next steps. Backup instructions will vary depending on the repository implementation. For example, using MySQL as a repository will require a different back procedure than Apache Derby. Please follow the repositories&#8217; backup procedure.</p>
<div class="section" id="upgrading-server-using-upgrade-tool">
<h3>Upgrading Server using upgrade tool<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-server-using-upgrade-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Preferred upgrade path is to explicitly run the <a class="reference external" href="Tools.html#upgrade">Upgrade Tool</a>. First step is to however shutdown the server as having both the server and upgrade utility accessing the same repository might corrupt it:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>sqoop2-server stop
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the server has been successfully stopped, you can update the server bits and simply run the upgrade tool:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>sqoop2-tool upgrade
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should see that the upgrade process has been successful:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>Tool class org.apache.sqoop.tools.tool.UpgradeTool has finished correctly.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In case of any failure, please take a look into <a class="reference external" href="Tools.html#upgrade">Upgrade Tool</a> documentation page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upgrading-server-on-start-up">
<h3>Upgrading Server on start-up<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-server-on-start-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The capability of performing the upgrade has been built-in to the server, however is disabled by default to avoid any unintentional changes to the repository. You can start the repository schema upgrade procedure by stopping the server:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>sqoop2-server stop
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Before starting the server again you will need to enable the auto-upgrade feature that will perform all necessary changes during Sqoop Server start up.</p>
<p>You need to set the following property in configuration file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqoop.properties</span></tt> for the repository schema upgrade.</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>org.apache.sqoop.repository.schema.immutable=false
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You need to set the following property in configuration file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqoop.properties</span></tt> for the connector config data upgrade.</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>org.apache.sqoop.connector.autoupgrade=true
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You need to set the following property in configuration file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqoop.properties</span></tt> for the driver config data upgrade.</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>org.apache.sqoop.driver.autoupgrade=true
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When all properties are set, start the sqoop server using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre>sqoop2-server start
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All required actions will be performed automatically during the server bootstrap. It&#8217;s strongly advised to set all three properties to their original values once the server has been successfully started and the upgrade has completed</p>

<h2>Upgrading Client<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-client" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Client do not require any manual steps during upgrade. Replacing the binaries with updated version is sufficient.</p>
